            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                In the dynamic world of programming, the simplicity and effectiveness of C combined with <code>make</code> for compiling are often underrated. This classic duo not only offers performance and control but also provides a streamlined, minimalistic approach to building software packages with minimal dependencies. Here’s why writing all programs in C and compiling them with <code>make</code> is an optimal choice, especially when simplicity and ease of use are paramount.

            <h2>Performance: The Speed Demon</h2>
            <p>
                C is like the sports car of programming languages. It's built for speed and efficiency. As a low-level language, it allows you to write code that directly interacts with hardware, resulting in highly optimized machine instructions. This is why critical systems like operating systems and embedded devices often rely on C. Unlike higher-level languages, C doesn't slow you down with unnecessary overhead, making it perfect for performance-sensitive applications.

            <h2>Portability: Write Once, Run Anywhere</h2>
            <p>
                C is the globetrotter of programming languages. Thanks to its widespread compiler support, you can write your code once and run it on almost any platform. Whether it's Windows, Linux, macOS, or even more obscure systems, C has got you covered. The ANSI C standard ensures your code follows a consistent specification, making cross-platform development a breeze.

            <h2>Simplicity: Less is More</h2>
            <p>
                C is simple, yet powerful. Its straightforward syntax makes it easy to learn and use, whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer. This simplicity doesn't mean C is lacking in capability—far from it. With C, you get a strong foundation without the distractions of overly complex features. It’s just you, your code, and the problem at hand.

            <h2>Control: Take the Wheel</h2>
            <p>
                C gives you unmatched control over your programs. You can manage memory manually, interact with hardware directly, and fine-tune your system's performance. This level of control is essential for applications requiring precise resource management. While this power comes with responsibility (and the occasional headache), it’s worth it for the flexibility and performance gains.

            <h2>The Power of Make: Your Build Buddy</h2>
            <p>
                <code>Make</code> is the perfect companion for C. This build automation tool handles the dirty work of compiling your code, so you don’t have to. Here’s why <code>make</code> is a game-changer, especially for those who appreciate minimalism and simplicity:
            </p>
            <h3>Minimal Dependencies: Keep It Simple</h3>
            <p>
                One of the standout features of <code>make</code> is its minimal dependency requirements. Unlike modern build systems that often require installing a host of additional tools and libraries, <code>make</code> is lightweight and straightforward. Most Unix-like systems come with <code>make</code> pre-installed, meaning you can start building your project right out of the box. This simplicity reduces setup time and avoids the hassle of managing numerous dependencies.
            </p>
            <h3>Ease of Use: No Rocket Science Needed</h3>
            <p>
                Using <code>make</code> is as simple as writing a few rules in a makefile. You don’t need to learn a complex new language or toolchain. The syntax of makefiles is intuitive and easy to understand, even for beginners. This ease of use makes <code>make</code> accessible to a wide range of developers, from novices to experts.
            </p>
            <h3>Flexibility and Customization: Tailor Your Build</h3>
            <p>
                With <code>make</code>, you can customize your build process to fit your project's needs. Define custom rules, macros, and variables to streamline your workflow. Whether you have complex build steps or specific compilation flags, <code>make</code> can handle it. This flexibility allows you to create a build process that is perfectly tailored to your project’s requirements without unnecessary complexity.
            </p>
            <h3>Dependency Management: Smarter Builds</h3>
            <p>
                <code>Make</code> automatically figures out what needs to be recompiled and what doesn’t, saving you from rebuilding everything from scratch every time you make a change. This incremental build process speeds up development and reduces frustration. <code>Make</code> keeps track of which parts of your code need to be recompiled, ensuring that your builds are efficient and only the necessary components are updated.
            </p>
            <h3>Portability and Standardization: Consistency Across Platforms</h3>
            <p>
                <code>Make</code> works on almost all Unix-like systems and has been ported to many others. This means you can use the same makefile across different environments, ensuring consistent builds and reducing platform-specific headaches. With <code>make</code>, you can maintain a standardized build process across various systems, enhancing the portability and reliability of your software.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                In the ever-evolving world of programming, sometimes the simplest solutions are the best. Writing programs in C and compiling them with <code>make</code> offers unparalleled performance, portability, simplicity, and control. The combination of C and <code>make</code> provides a streamlined approach to software development, with minimal dependencies and easy setup. So next time you start a project, consider going back to the basics with C and <code>make</code>. You might just find that the old-school approach is still the best way to get the job done, especially when you value simplicity and minimalism in your build process. Fuck a lot of dependencies and a bunch of interpreters! Glory to С and minimalism!
