        <h1>Why All Programs Should Be Written in C and Compiled with Make</h1>
    </header>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Let’s cut to the chase: if you’re not writing your programs in C and compiling them with <code>make</code>, you’re doing it wrong. Forget all the bloated, slow, and overly complex languages and build tools out there. Here’s why you need to embrace the raw power of C and the simplicity of <code>make</code>—and do it now.

            <h2>Performance: No More Excuses</h2>
            <p>
                C is the undisputed champion when it comes to performance. If you care about speed—and you should—C is your only real option. High-level languages introduce unnecessary overhead that you just can’t afford. Whether you’re writing an OS, a game engine, or a high-frequency trading algorithm, C’s low-level capabilities let you squeeze out every last drop of performance. Anything else is just playing pretend.

            <h2>Portability: Stop Limiting Yourself</h2>
            <p>
                One codebase, every platform. That’s what C offers. Thanks to its near-universal compiler support, you’re not chained to a single ecosystem. Your C code will run on Windows, Linux, macOS, and a dozen other systems you’ve never heard of. The ANSI C standard ensures that your code will work anywhere. If your language doesn’t offer this kind of portability, why are you still using it?
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Simplicity: Cut the Fat</h2>
            <p>
                Simplicity is a feature, not a drawback. C gives you a clear, concise syntax without all the cruft. You won’t waste time wrestling with pointless abstractions or convoluted syntax. You write your code, it does what you expect, and you move on. Other languages might promise you the world, but they deliver it with a pile of unnecessary complexity. Stick with C and keep it simple.
            </p>

            <h2>Control: Be the Boss</h2>
            <p>
                With C, you’re in control. You decide how memory is managed, how hardware is accessed, and how your program performs. This level of control is non-negotiable for serious developers. You don’t want some garbage collector making decisions for you, and you definitely don’t want to be at the mercy of a virtual machine. C puts you in the driver’s seat.

            <h2>The Power of Make: Stop Wasting Time</h2>
            <p>
                <code>Make</code> is the build tool that does its job and gets out of your way. Forget those over-engineered, dependency-laden monstrosities masquerading as build systems. <code>Make</code> is straightforward, lightweight, and effective. Here’s why <code>make</code> is the only build tool you need:
            </p>
            <h3>Minimal Dependencies: No More Bloat</h3>
            <p>
                <code>Make</code> doesn’t need a thousand dependencies to get your project built. Most Unix-like systems come with <code>make</code> pre-installed. You can set up your build process without wasting half a day installing and configuring other tools. Less setup, more coding.
            </p>
            <h3>Ease of Use: It’s Not Rocket Science</h3>
            <p>
                Writing a makefile is dead simple. You don’t need a PhD to understand how it works. Define your targets, list your dependencies, and you’re done. It’s that easy. Other build tools might require you to learn a whole new language or framework, but <code>make</code> keeps it simple and efficient.
            </p>
            <h3>Flexibility and Customization: Have It Your Way</h3>
            <p>
                With <code>make</code>, you can tailor your build process to fit your needs. Define custom rules, set variables, and automate everything without unnecessary complexity. You’re not locked into someone else’s idea of how a build should work. With <code>make</code>, you’re in control.
            </p>
            <h3>Dependency Management: Smarter Builds</h3>
            <p>
                <code>Make</code> keeps track of which files need to be recompiled, so you don’t waste time rebuilding everything from scratch. Incremental builds save you time and frustration. Let <code>make</code> handle the dependencies so you can focus on writing code.
            </p>
            <h3>Portability and Standardization: Consistency is Key</h3>
            <p>
                <code>Make</code> works across virtually all Unix-like systems and has been ported to others. Use the same makefile on different platforms and ensure consistent builds. No more dealing with platform-specific quirks or build tools that only work on certain systems. <code>Make</code> gives you reliability and consistency.
            </p>

            <h2>Conclusion: Time to Get Serious</h2>
            <p>
                If you’re serious about programming, you need to get serious about your tools. C and <code>make</code> are the power couple you need in your life. Performance, portability, simplicity, control—C has it all. <code>Make</code> complements C by offering a straightforward, effective way to build your projects with minimal dependencies. Stop wasting time with inferior tools and languages. Make the switch to C and <code>make</code> and start getting things done the right way. Fuck a lot of dependencies and a bunch of interpreters! Glory to С and minimalism!
